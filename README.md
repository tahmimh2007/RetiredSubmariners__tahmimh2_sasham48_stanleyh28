# Submarine Charts By RetiredSubmariners
Roster: Tahmim Hassan (frontend), Stanley Hoo (backend), Sasha Murati (backend)


Overview:
Our site will allow users to display their data from csv/json files on charts or to create ML models based on their data. The format is as follows:
- User uploads dataset (we will figure out file format)
- User selects either automatic or manual headings (auto will try to detect headings in csv/json files and use those, manual users will enter name for each field)
- User selects 2 or more categories to plot in a selected type of plot (kinda like a checkbox dropdown menu to select fields to plot, another dropdown for type of plot)
- Possible ML data analysis/training (PCA, logistic regression, Xgboost, randomforest, etc) especially if binary classification
